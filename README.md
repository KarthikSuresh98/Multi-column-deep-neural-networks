# Multi-column-deep-neural-networks
Recreating a research paper on multi column deep neural networks (mcdnn) and obtaining the improved accuracy on standard datasets.
The goal of the project is to test the effectiveness of multi column deep neural network architecture. 

The concept of mcdnn architecture was implemented on Mnist , Fashion-Mnist and Cifar10 datasets. All of them showed significant
improvements in the training and testing accuracy thus showing the effectiveness of this model

The model was implemented on these datasets with the help of Keras library. The mcdnn.tf is yet to be completed. It is a program
to recreate the model in tensorflow.
